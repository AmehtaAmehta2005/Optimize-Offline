# Upcoming Features In-Progress #

This is to give a bit of information and insight as to what features are currently being implemented and tested on future versions of Optimize-Offline, what to expect and what will be getting implemented.
All of these features, modules and add-ons are already either complete or going through debugging stages.

* Managed WimgApi and DismApi dynamic libraries (these are almost complete as of 01-08-2020 and being tested in beta releases).
* Offline update integrations.
* A full XML writer add-on module will allow for the creation of Answer Files.
* Current Windows Apps and manifests will be able to be updated.
* Full core component removal options and advanced imaging features.
* The creation of custom WindowsPE bootable images will be implemented.
* The ability to apply the image directly to a Virtual Disk or physical disk will be implemented using native Microsoft Win32 dlls (VirtDisk.dll, etc.)
* Local and network deployment compatibility.
* Additional runtime modules to further customize and attain full control over your system.
* Many, many more features.

**The full GUI version is in its alpha stage and has been delayed to ensure complete compatibility with PowerShell 6. Its release will be coming soon, though.**
